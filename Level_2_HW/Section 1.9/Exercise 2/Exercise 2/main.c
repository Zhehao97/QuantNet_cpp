// fgets(): It reads a line from the specified stream and stores it into the string pointed to by str. It stops when either (n-1) characters are read, the newline character is read, or the end-of-file is reached, whichever comes first.
    
    // 1. It is safe to use because it checks the array bound.

// gets(): Reads characters from the standard input (stdin) and stores them as a C string into str until a newline character or the end-of-file is reached.

    // 1. It is not safe to use because it does not check the array bound.
