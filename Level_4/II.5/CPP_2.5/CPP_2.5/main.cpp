//  Memory Scenarios
//
//  Lifecycle management on the heap. Normal scenarios.
//
//  Some exceptions:
//
//      1. No memory allocated for a ptr
//      2. Accessing null/undefined ptr
//      3. Ptr goes out of scope but pointee (memory has been cleaned up)
//      4. 'Double' delete

/*
Differences between a class and a struct in C++ are that structs have default public members and bases and classes have default private members and bases. Both classes and structs can have a mixture of public, protected and private members, can use inheritance and can have member functions.

I would recommend using structs as plain-old-data structures without any class-like features, and using classes as aggregate data structures with private data and member functions.
